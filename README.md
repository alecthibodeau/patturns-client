# Patturns
## Full-Stack Project: Client/API

## Summary

My project is a pattern maker. Users can change the color of cells on a 8x8 grid as a visual tool to sketch ideas for various purposes: engineering, drawing, quilting or as a creative, meditative exercise.

## User Stories

- As a visitor to the Patturns website I want to know how to sign up and sign in so that I can become a user.

- As a signed-in user I need to see the options available to me so that I can create a new pattern, access/modify patterns that have already been created, change my password or sign out.

- As a user wanting to create a new pattern I need to see my color options so that I can use them to design the pattern.

- As a user wanting to save a newly made pattern I need to know how to associate helpful text information with my pattern and then submit them together so that the entire pattern is created on my database.

- As a user wanting to access created patterns I need to know how to call all patterns that have been created in the database so that I can see or modify them.

- As a user wanting to modify a pattern I need to see all my saved patterns so that I can update or delete a specific one.
