# Patturns
## Full-Stack Project: Client

## Description

Patturns is a pattern-making visual tool for both practical and fun purposes. Users can make patterns by changing the colors of cells on the screen's 10 x 10 grid with a trackpad, mouse or mobile interface. Patturns is applicable for basic projects in engineering, quilting, mosaics and more. Patturns can also serve as a relaxing exercise and a creativity stimulator.

Why "Patturns" as a name? My ultimate feature for this project would be a user network, allowing people to pass patterns back forth to each other: taking turns working together on a shared pattern.

## Technologies

I developed the Patturns website as my final project while a student in the Web Development Immersive (WDI) course at General Assembly. I used JavaScript, CSS3/Sass, HTML5, Handlebars – with some Bootstrap for modals – as my primary technologies for the front-end work. For the back-end I built an API using MongoDB, Express and Node.js. The database is stored at Heroku.

Technical Specifications
- Single page application
- Custom API
- RESTful routes for handling GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling
- AJAX for interacting with the custom API
- Responsive web design with original styling

## User Stories

- As a visitor to the Patturns website I want to know how to sign up and sign in so that I can become a user.

- As a signed-in user I need to see the options available to me so that I can create a new pattern, access/modify patterns that have already been created, change my password or sign out.

- As a user wanting to create a new pattern I need to see my color options so that I can use them to design the pattern.

- As a user wanting to save a newly made pattern I need to know how to associate helpful text information with my pattern and then submit them together so that the entire pattern is saved on my database.

- As a user wanting to access saved patterns I need to know how to call all patterns that have been created in the database so that I can see or modify them.

- As a user wanting to modify a pattern I need to see all my saved patterns so that I can update or delete a specific one.

## Future Features

- Add more color choices.
- Add a feature to cycle through saved patterns at faster or slower speeds: for animation and slide-show effects, respectively.
